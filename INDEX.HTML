    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>My name is Mohammed Minhajul Islam, and I am a student of class 9, navigating the world of learning with enthusiasm and dedication. Beyond the classroom, I find joy in activities that fuel both my body and soul. Swimming allows me to embrace the cool waters, feeling the freedom and strength that each stroke brings. Cycling is my escape, taking me through different paths and landscapes, where I enjoy the beauty of the world around me. However, it is poetry that touches the deepest part of me. Through verses and words, I express emotions, experiences, and dreams, painting pictures with the rhythm of language. Together, these hobbies shape who I am, giving me balance, creativity, andÂ inspiration.</p>
